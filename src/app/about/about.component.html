<h1>About</h1>
<p>Gin is in. Although it has been with us for centuries, there has been a recent revival of interest in the spirit, and a profusion of new brands with fresh flavours and eye-catching serves.</p>
<p>It's hard to keep up with all of the new gins from Ireland, let alone the many hundreds from other countries. But we can help! Every month we sample a selection of gins side-by-side, while hearing the story behind them - often from the makers themselves. Each tasting is based around a different theme, with a fresh line-up of tasty gins each time. You can see details of all of our events <a routerLink="/events">here</a>.</p>
<p> We've tried gins that are not available in Ireland. We've even tried gins before they were available anywhere! If you are curious about gin, if you want to try new gins as they are released, if you want to find the perfect gin for you, please join us for one of our fun and informative evenings.</p>
