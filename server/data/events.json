Every season, working with local forager <a href=\"http://www.wicklowwildfoods.com/\">Geraldine Kavanagh</a>, they spend a week in the wilds of the Wicklow countryside foraging for the freshest and most interesting local botanicals, berries and fruit which they distil into four unique and delicious seasonal gins.</p><p>Come taste the results, meet Geraldine and distiller Ciarán \"Rowdy\" Rooney, and discover that gin truly is a Winter drink. And a Spring drink, and a Summer drink, and an Autumn drink!</p>",

Tasting at once fruity and tannic, it’s best sipped and savoured in cosy surroundings on a Winter’s evening.</p><p>This is great as an aperitif or after dinner with dessert or cheeses. Many sloe gins will have a lower ABV. Such is the quality and taste of Glendalough Sloe Gin it may still be sipped neat or on ice at 43%.
